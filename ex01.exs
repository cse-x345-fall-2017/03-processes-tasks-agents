  @moduledoc """

  In this exercise you'll implement a simple process that acts as a
  counter. Each time you send it `{:next, from}`, it will send to
  `from` the tuple `{:next_is, value}`, and that value will increase
  by one on each call. You code will allow you to set the initial
  value returned.

  The tests in the following module are commented out.

  You'll uncomment each in turn, and then write the code in the
  Ex01 module to make that test pass. You've finished when all the
  tests are uncommented and pass.

  DO NOT USE THE TASK OR AGENT LIBRARIES FOR THIS TEST.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  ## For each test (2 in all):  10

        6 does the code compile and pass the tests
        2 is the program written in an idiomatic style that uses
          appropriate and effective language and library features
        2 is the program well laid out,  appropriately using indentation,
          blank lines, vertical alignment
